## About Myself:
After ending universiy in 2018, worked 4 year as railway engenier. 
In first's years of working i've stared looking for opportunities to realize professional growth.
In the conclusion i've undestood that it is necessary to change my profession and started learning programming in free time. 

My hobby is drawing and painting.
I have strong math skils and basic knowledge of working with code. 
I like to create something new and realise that Frontend developing gives this posibility.

        var n = target - nums[i]

        if (n in map) {return [i, map[n]]};
